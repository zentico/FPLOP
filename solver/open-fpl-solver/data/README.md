# Setting Explanations

This file documents all configurable settings for the FPL solver. Settings are organized by complexity:

- **[User-Friendly Settings](#user-friendly-settings)** – Essential options for most users (see `user_settings.json`)
- **[Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings)** – Fine-tuning options (see `comprehensive_settings.json`)
- **[Complete Reference](#complete-reference)** – Full alphabetical listing of all settings

---

## User-Friendly Settings

These are the core settings most users will interact with. You'll find them in `user_settings.json`.

### Planning Horizon
- `horizon`: length of the planning horizon (number of gameweeks to optimize)
  - Example: `"horizon": 4` (plan 4 gameweeks ahead)

### Decay & Valuation
- `decay_base`: value assigned to decay rate of expected points (discounts future GWs)
  - Example: `"decay_base": 0.9` (10% discount per GW)
- `ft_value_list`: values of rolling free transfers in different states
  - Example: `"ft_value_list": {"2": 2, "3": 1.6, "4": 1.3, "5": 1.1}` assigns value 2.0 for rolling from 1FT to 2FTs, 1.6 for rolling from 2FTs to 3FTs, etc.

### Data Source & Team
- `datasource`: specifies which projection CSV to use or `"mixed"` for multiple sources
  - Example: `"datasource": "solio"` if your projections file is called `solio.csv`
- `team_data`: how to supply your team data. Must be one of:
  - `"id"` – look up your team via the `team_id` you supply
  - `"json"` – read team data from a `data/team.json` file (see [getting_team_json.md](getting_team_json.md) for how to get one).
  - `"json_string"` – supply team data inline via `team_json`

  Using `json` or `json_string` is necessary when you have already made transfers in a gameweek and want these to be taken into account for your solve.
- `preseason`: set to `true` for a solve with no initial squad (`team_data`/`team_id`/`team_json` are ignored). This is mostly used pre-GW1, but can also be used for teams joining the game late.
  - Example: `"preseason": false`

### Player Pool Filtering
- `xmin_lb`: drop players below this many expected minutes across the horizon
  - Example: `"xmin_lb": 300` (drop players with under 300 expected minutes)
- `ev_per_price_cutoff`: drop players below this percentile of expected value per price
  - Example: `"ev_per_price_cutoff": 30` (drop bottom 30%)
- `keep_top_ev_percent`: force the filtering to always keep the top n% of players by total expected value, even if they would have been otherwise filtered out by other steps
  - Example: `"keep_top_ev_percent": 5` (avoid filtering out players in the top 5% by total EV)

### Player Constraints
- `banned`: list of player IDs to exclude from entire horizon
  - Example: `"banned": []`
- `locked`: list of player IDs to always keep in squad
  - Example: `"locked": [430]` (always include player 430 (Haaland))

### Transfer Constraints
- `no_transfer_last_gws`: number of gameweeks at end where transfers are banned
  - Example: `"no_transfer_last_gws": 0`

### Chips
- `use_wc`: list of gameweeks to use Wildcard
  - Example: `"use_wc": []` or `"use_wc": [15]`
- `use_bb`: list of gameweeks to use Bench Boost
  - Example: `"use_bb": [25]`
- `use_fh`: list of gameweeks to use Free Hit
  - Example: `"use_fh": []`
- `use_tc`: list of gameweeks to use Triple Captain
  - Example: `"use_tc": []`

### Output
- `verbose`: whether to print solver progress to screen
  - Example: `"verbose": true`

## Advanced Settings

These settings provide fine-grained control over the optimization. Most users won't need to adjust these. See `comprehensive_settings.json` for default values.

### Scoring & Objective Function
- `ft_value`: value (in points) assigned to having one extra free transfer
  - Example: `"ft_value": 1.5`

- `vcap_weight`: weight for vice-captain points in the objective function
  - Example: `"vcap_weight": 0.1`
- `itb_value`: value (in points) assigned to having 1.0 extra budget in the bank
  - Example: `"itb_value": 0.08`

  - Example: `"transfer_itb_buffer": null` or `0.1` to leave £0.1m in bank
- `booked_transfers`: pre-scheduled transfers for future gameweeks
  - Format: `[{"gw": 5, "transfer_in": 427}, {"gw": 7, "transfer_out": 427}]` (buy player 427 on GW5, sell on GW7)

Used with `simulations.py` to model fixture uncertainty (e.g. postponed/rearranged fixtures). Covers `binary_file_weights`, `generate_binary_files`, and `binary_fixture_settings` — see [binary_fixtures.md](binary_fixtures.md) for full setup instructions and examples.
